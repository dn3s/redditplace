# redditplace.py

Quick python script that prints a view of reddit's
[place](https://www.reddit.com/place?webview=true) thing to your terminal usung
ANSI color codes and Unicode block characters. Requires a recent python3 and a
terminal that supports 256 colors and unicode.

## Usage

`./redditplace.py` will center on the middle of the canvas. Put your x and y
coordinates in as parameters (for example `./redditplace.py 193 585`) to
specify an alternate center. Add "explore" as an argument to roam around the
canvas interactively using WASD or HJKL keys.
